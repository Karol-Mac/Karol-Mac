# About me
I'm a third year's computer science student, passionate about programming.
I'm hungry og new knoledge and fortunately I'm a very fast learner.
I'm mainly intrseted in backend programming, but I also find intresting databases or project-managing.

## Why backend?
I have always wanted to be the 'man at the helm', and the backend provides that opportunity.
This is where most of the 'magic' happens. I'm no stranger to programming the front part of an application and I have nothing against it, it's just that the backend is more interesting.
