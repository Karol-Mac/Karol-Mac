# About me
I'm a fourth year's computer science student, passionate about programming.
I'm hungry of new knoledge and fortunately I'm a very fast learner.
I'm mainly intrested in backend programming, but I also find intresting databases or project-managing.

## Why backend?
I have always wanted to be the 'man at the helm', and the backend provides that opportunity.
This is where most of the 'magic' happens. I'm no stranger to programming the front part of an application and I have nothing against it, it's just that the backend is more interesting. 

## What am I currently do?
I wokring on imporoving my java knowleadge.
I am preparing for the exam IZ0-829 (Oracle Certified Profesional Java SE 17 Developer).
In between I am also developing existing projects & thinkig about new ideas ðŸ¤“

## My Hobbies
In addition to programming, I also enjoy few other things. For example:
- cycling
- singing - choral and solo
- strength training
